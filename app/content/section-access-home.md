Dispenser for Safe Water is a proven, innovative, low-cost approach to increase household chlorination.   

Access refers to the number of people Dispensers for Safe Water serves across the three countries of our operation. We collect and verify data on the number of households that are using a given waterpoint. We then estimate the number of people per household, based on monthly surveys of randomly selected households in that catchment area.
