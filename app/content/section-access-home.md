Dispensers for Safe Water are a proven, innovative, and low-cost approach to increase rates of household chlorination.  

Access refers to the number of people served by Dispensers for Safe Water across the three countries of ouroperation. We collect and verify data on the number of households that are using a given waterpoint. We then estimate the number of people per household based on monthly surveys of randomly selected households in that catchment area.
