title: Reliability
---
We monitor whether dispensers are functional, do not need repairs, and are filled with chlorine to assess how reliable our service is. Reliability is a critical factor in user adoption as empty or broken dispensers are not usable. We define a functional dispenser as one that releases a proper dose of chlorine (3ml), and requires no repairs. Data is gathered by our circuit riders on each trip that chlorine is delivered to the dispenser.
