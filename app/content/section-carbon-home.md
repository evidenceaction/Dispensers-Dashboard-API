title: Revenue from Carbon Credits 
---
We sell carbons credits on carbon markets to generate revenue and offset our costs of running Dispensers for Safe Water. 

A carbon credit represents one ton of carbon dioxide or equivalent of greenhouse gases removed or not emitted into the atmosphere. Companies with greenhouse gas reduction targets purchase carbon credits from “offset” projects in developing countries, provided that those projects also contribute to sustainable development priorities. Dispenser for Safe Water is certified by 3rd party auditors to generate such carbon credits by averting the greenhouse gas emissions from a carbon-intensive activity like boiling water in favor of a cleaner safe water technology like chlorine dispensers.
