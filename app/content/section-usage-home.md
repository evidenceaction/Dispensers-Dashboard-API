The adoption rate is an important measure of the use of dispensers by the community. It is the percentage of randomly sampled households that tested positive for residual chlorine ('Total Chlorine Residual') in their drinking water during an unannounced household visit. 1.5% of all dispensers that we have installed are evaluated that way every month. For the first three months of evaluation in a new geographic area, we increase that to 2% of dispensers monitored. Additionally, a random selection of eight households are interviewed at each dispenser site by our Monitoring and Learning Team for qualititative information about adoption and usage in that particular village.
