The adoption rate is an important measure of the use of dispensers. It is a percentage of randomly sampled households that tested positive for Total Chlorine Residual in their drinking water during an unannounced visit. 1.5% of all dispensers are evaluated every month. For the first three months of evaluation in a new region, 2% of all dispensers are monitored. A random selection of 8 households are interviewed at each dispenser by our Monitoring and Learning Team.
